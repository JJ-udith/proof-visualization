# Proof-Visualization
## Introduction

This project was developed as part of my bachelor thesis. The goal of the project was to find out if and how visualizations can effectively support the proof of algorithms. Therefore a support system should be designed. The Proof-Visualization App is the prototype of this support system. It consists of two different visualizations: successor and stack.

## Technologies

* Node: 16.18.0
* Yarn: 1.22.17
* next: 12.3.1
* eslint-config-next: 12.3.1
* react: 18.2.0
* react-dom: 18.2.0

## Launch

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Successor Algorithm Visualization

To reproduce the proof and apply the visualization, proceed as follows:
Go to [Verifast](https://github.com/verifast/verifast), download and install Verifast according to your operation system.
Open the successor.c file from [here](./algorithms/successor.c) in Verifast.
On the Successor page it is now possible to display the assumptions collected in Verifast on a number line.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
